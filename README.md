## Title of Extension

Abyssal Village (Lords of the Land but a horror game)

## Brief Overview of game 

I plan to extend the project by leaning heavily into the horror genre, with enemies to avoid while the player tends to their crops. The player's goal will be to earn enough money for their family to join another village, as the one they're currently in has been overrun by monsters. The game will cycle between day and night, and the player will have access to different actions during each stage. 

During the day, the player can safely grow crops, collect resources, and trade with the shopkeeper. The family will also need to be fed during this time if they are hungry. During the night, however, the player will only be able to tend to the fields and must fend off any monsters that may appear while doing so. Vision will be impaired by the darkness and the player must depend on lanterns scattered across the farmland to survive. These lanterns will prevent the monsters from attacking the player while standing in their radius, but only last a certain time before needing to be relit.

As a base, there will be two enemy types: the chaser and the nest. When the player enters the chaser's field of vision, it will relentlessly chase them until enough time has passed or until the player uses a lantern. The nest, on the other hand, will be a stationary enemy that spawns primarily near fields and waits for the player to get close. Once the player is in range, the nest will reach an arm out in an attempt to trap the player, and will try to pull them in if successful.

In addition to these core features, I aim to implement a form of combat the player can utilize to escape dangerous situations. They would be able to take a lantern and throw it to kill a monster with the risk of losing that lantern permanently.

## Must Have Features

- **Enemies** At least two types of enemies who will threaten the player while they try to grow crops and feed their family. One will be a basic enemy that chases the player and the other will be stationary and attempt to grab the player when they get too close.

- **Day/Night Cycle** The player will have the day to plant any crops safely, while enemies spawn during the night. A complete day/night cycle will only last around 2.5 minutes to quicken the pace of the game.

- **Lanterns/Light System** The player's main method of fending off enemies will be through lanterns, which will cause them to lose aggro when entering the light's radius. They will fizzle out after a certain amount of time and the player will need to relight them, although they can only be relit a few times each day.


## Should Have Features

- **Exploration** Give the player access to the abandoned village to explore for potential items. Enemies will only spawn in the village during the night.

- **Combat** The player can take a lantern to throw at and kill a monster, but that lantern will be permanently gone afterwards. Will give the player the ability to deal with a particularly annoying enemy, but requires a massive sacrifice.


## Could Have Features

- **Pickups** Allow items to drop on the ground to be picked up for a small time. Enemies could drop special items if the player

- **Text boxes** Text boxes may appear when interacting with certain objects. 

- **Extra Enemy Types** Extra types of enemies to add some difficulty to the nights. My ideas for enemy types include ones that move in quick bursts, ones that only move when the player isn't looking at them (Doctor Who's Weeping Angels), and ones that attempt to steal/sabotage crops


## Wish to Have Features

- **Spoiling food** Food can spoil if not sold or eaten after a certain number of days. Could force the player to think carefully about when they use or sell their food, but might also lead to a game where the difficulty is focused more toward the resource management rather than the monsters, which I want to avoid.

- **Random encounters** Once per day, there is a chance that a serf will run through your land and ask for a certain resource. If you're able to provide it before they leave, then you'll earn some extra coin compared to what you would have gotten by selling it normally.
